ElectroMart Coupon and E-Commerce Platform Performance Analysis

This repository contains the data, analysis, and dashboard for the ElectroMart coupon and e-commerce platform performance evaluation. The goal of this analysis was to determine the true

The analysis provides actionable insights for management to optimize future marketing campaigns by shifting resources to platforms and coupons that yield a lower cost per unit sold.

üõ†Ô∏è Data & Technology Stack

This project is primarily a data analysis and reporting effort.

‚Ä¢	Core Technology: Google Sheets / Spreadsheet (where the analysis, calculations, and dashboard were performed).

‚Ä¢	Data Inputs: Coupon-Platform raw transaction data including Coupon ID, Platform Spend (in Rs.), and Units Sold.

‚Ä¢	Key Metric: Cost Per Unit (CPU).

‚Ä¢	Deployment/Hosting: Spreadsheet/PDF Report (for sharing of findings)

The project details you provided are a business performance analysis in the form of a spreadsheet/dashboard, not a software application.
Therefore, the README should be written for a Data Analysis Repository, focusing on the insights, methodology, and data files, rather than a software build process.
Here is the README.md based on the provided data, adapted to the structure of a data analysis project:

üöÄ Getting Started (Accessing the Data)

To view the raw data, analysis steps, and dashboard, you would typically need the original spreadsheet file or access to the live environment.
Prerequisites

‚Ä¢	A Spreadsheet application capable of reading .xlsx or .csv files (e.g., Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, LibreOffice Calc).

üíª Example Usage Scenario

A marketing manager reviews the 
E-Commerce Platform Performance section of the dashboard:

1.	They observe that Amazon has the highest CPU (25).

2.	They observe that Blinkit has the lowest CPU (14.67).

3.	Action: The manager decides to reduce budget allocation to Amazon and increase budget allocation to Blinkit for the next campaign to lower the overall Cost Per Unit.
